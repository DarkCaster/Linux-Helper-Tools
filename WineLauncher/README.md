Simple helper scripts to perform some typical tasks like customized wine installation compile\deploy, prefix management, application launching, etc.
Most of configuration performed by using lua config scripts (by using tools from my BashLuaHelper project).

TODO: usage, examples, modifications for unattended setup\run.
