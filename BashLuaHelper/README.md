# Bash Lua Helper

Parse and provide readonly access to selected global variables from lua scripts for use inside your bash (or posix-shell) scripts.
You can use this tool to provide an advanced configuration facility for use with your bash-scripts, and use all features provided by lua language to perform management of config file options.
You can also put all verification logic to a separate script, that will be executed right after main config script.

You need an installed lua interpreter in your system. Tested with Lua v5.2.2
