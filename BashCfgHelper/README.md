# Bash Cfg Helper

Provide readonly access to ini-file strings, for use inside your bash scripts.
Using crudini utility (https://github.com/pixelb/crudini) to parse ini files, and slighlty extends it's features.

NOTE: Not recomended for production use. Performance is bad, may contain bugs.
I've create this script long time ago for a very specific use case.
I have no plans to improve, redesign, or fix it (if something is broken).
