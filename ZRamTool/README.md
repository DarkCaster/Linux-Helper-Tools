# zramtool

Utility script for managing zram devices, written in bash. **Please, consider to use zramctl from util-linux package instead of this tool**. This is slightly renewed version of my very old helper script for working with zram devices, I'm not using it currently and it may contain bugs. It kept here mainly for archival purposes.
