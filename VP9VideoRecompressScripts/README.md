# VP9 video recompression scripts

Some simple and ugly scripts i've made in order to automate mass-recompression of my video material.
Will be completely reworked someday, end extended with advanced lua configuration from my BashLuaHelper project.
For now, this scripts generally is not recommended for use at all, it contain bugs and most likely will not work as intended.
